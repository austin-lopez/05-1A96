	<p>The start of [REDACTED] is almost always visible from outer space. The event spawns a cluster of large, intense storm-like 
		<br>weather patterns, producing enough heat and light to rival a star. It is unlikely that any lifeform can withstand these conditions.
	<br>It is suspected that [REDACTED] are the root cause of these storms.</p>
